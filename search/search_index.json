We define, modify, use these variables and objects to make our programs run. Programs use key words to define characteristics of variables or objects. Basic keywords: public - an object accessible by other classes (files) private - an object only accessible by its containing class (file). protected - like private but can be seen by subclasses return - value to return or give back after method execution (run). void - a method that returns no value IMPORTANT NOTE Java is case sensitive, meaning capitalization matters! Classes # Classes are the files that contain our programming A program can be made up of one class but can also be made up of many classes All programs run a main class that can optionally load additional classes either directly or indirectly Example main loads class1, class1 loads class2 Classes are made up of variables and methods and are often used to separate and organize your code. Classes can also call (use) variables or methods of other classes if those have been set to public. Constructors # Classes can also have a constructor which is a special type of method that has the same name (case sensitive) as the class file Constructors are always called when the class is loaded into the program for the first time. This is often the only time they are called. Constructors are called when trying to access the class in other files. They can be called again if the class is programmed to be unloaded (destroyed) and reloaded. Calls to methods, and assignment of values, within the constructor will run as soon as the class is called (loaded) in the code. Variables # Variables are objects that contain data, they are characterized by data types Variables are assigned names and data types on creation Names can be anything with the exception of pre-existing keywords such as public or int Data types define what type of data is being stored in the variables: int - integers (whole numbers) double - double precision floating point (fractional/decimal values) boolean - true or false (true = 1 or false = 0) values. string - text values contained in parentheses Example: int sum; A variable that can hold whole number values Example: boolean isFull = true; A variable can either hold a true or false value and is being assigned a true value Most non-static variables can have their values assigned or assigned at any point elsewhere in your program Methods # Methods, also known as functions, can be thought of as subprograms or routines that run inside of your main program. Methods are used when you want to run the same code multiple times. Copying and pasting code is BAD! Use methods instead! Methods are also useful to access only certain parts or functions of another class. Methods can also have their own variables (local) or use variables available throughout the whole class (global variables), this will be explained more in the scope section. Methods can call (use) other methods, even multiple times. Example int value ; void increment (){ value ++; } Scope # When creating a variable, where you create it matters. This is known as the scope of a variable. The scope is where a variable can be seen within a class A variable created in a method can only be seen in that method. This is a local variable. A variable created outside a method can be seen in all methods of that class (file). This is a global variable. It is good practice to put them all at the top before your first method. Example of a Local Variable public int testMethod () { int example = 12 ; // Instide of method example = example + 1 ; return example } Example of a Public Variable int example = 12 ; // Outside of method public void testMethod () { example = example + 1 ; return example } Parameters # Parameters are variables that are passed (sent) to a method for it to use. You can pass more than one parameter but order matters when calling the method. Example // Example of a method with a parameter double half ( int num1 ){ double multiplier = 0.5 ; return num1 * multiplier ; } int newNumber = half ( 12 ); // <---- Method being called (used) in code Comments # Comments are a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a program. Comments do not affect what the code does. Comments are often used to leave notes or explanations of what methods or classes are doing so that it is easier to understand the code. Example: Single Line Comments // This is what a single line comment looks like // You can also have multiple // single line comments in a row Example: Multi Line Comments /* This is what a multiline comment looks like */ Example: Doc Comments /** * This is a doc comment * * <ul> * <li>They can be viewed by hovering over code they are attached to</li> * <li>They can be formatted with HTML</li> * </ul> */ Conventions # There are also many different conventions when programming, this ensures that programs are readable between different people. A common naming convention: Programming is often done in CamelCase or lowerCamelCase Instead of adding spaces, capitalize the first letter of each word Example ThreeMotorDrive, driveForward, setSpeed Info There are other naming conventions, but for this tutorial we will use the camel cases","title":"Java Programming Basics"},{"location":"basics/java_basics.html#java_programming_basics","text":"Learning What's What","title":"Java Programming Basics"},{"location":"basics/java_basics.html#overview","text":"Objects, variables, and classes (in Java) make up our programs.
